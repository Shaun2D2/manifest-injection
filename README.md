# manifest-injection

### Why did you do this?

This is a simple example that shows you can load in a manifest file by injecting it into the head of the page... it's pretty sweet :heart:

### Installation

You need to run `npm install` in both core-app & manifest-app folders.

### Run The Project

You `npm start` on both of the apps, you need to have different terminal windows open to run both at the same time...

Once running, head over to `http://localhost:3000` which will load up the app.  You can confirm the manifest loaded with Chrome dev tools (because your a pro and don't use IE).  Open the Application tab, and find the manifest.
